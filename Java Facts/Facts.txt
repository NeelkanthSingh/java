Java is a compiled/Interpreted language.
Compiled means all the code is converted into machine code before it is executed.
Interpreted means the code is converted into machine code as it is executed.

Java is a statically typed language. This means that the type of variable is known at compile time while in dynamically typed languages, the type of variable is known at run time.

Java code is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
JDK contains JRE which contains JVM. The compiler is part of the JDK.
JRE contains JVM. The interpreter is part of the JRE.
JVM is the same for all platforms. This means that the same Java program can be run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Memory Stack: Stack memory in java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread.
LIFO (Last In First Out) is the order of allocation and de-allocation of memory in the stack.
The stack is used for storing the local variables and method parameters.
The stack is also used for storing the reference variables of the objects.
The stack is also used for storing the return address of the methods.
The stack is also used for storing the primitive data types.

Memory Heap: Space is used to store objects and JRE classes at runtime.
New objects are created in the heap.
Reference variables are stored in the stack and the objects are stored in the heap.

Frame: A stack frame contains all the data for a single method call.
It contains the local variables, method parameters, return address, and other information.
The stack frame is created when a method is called and destroyed when the method returns.

Memory Method Area:
The method area is used to store the class level information like the name of the class, modifiers, fields, methods, constructors, static variables, and static methods.

Pass by value: In Java, all parameters are passed by value. This means that the value of the variable is passed to the method.

In a conditional expression, the expression is joined with and or or. The expression is evaluated from left to right. If the first expression is true, the second expression is not evaluated. If the first expression is false, the second expression is evaluated.

In switch statements, the case labels must be constants. The case labels must be of the same type as the switch expression. The case labels must be unique. The case labels must be compile-time constants.
In switch case, to get an OR scenario, we can use the fall-through feature. This means that we can use the same code for multiple cases.
In switch case, the expression can be of type byte, short, char, int, enum, String. Or Byte, Short, Character, Integer.

In Java, when two class have same name but different package, to use both classes, we can use fully qualified name, for one class, we can use import statement, and for one class, we can use fully qualified name.
In Java, Classes under java.lang package are imported by default. We don't need to import them explicitly.

Access modifiers in Java are public, private, protected, and default.
Access modifiers in java are only for classes, attributes, methods, and constructors.
default is the default access modifier. It is used when we don't specify any access modifier.
default access modifier only allows access within the package.

static keyword associates with the class rather than the object.
static method only allow access to static variables.

In Java, main method is what the JVM looks for to start the program. The main method is static. The main method is public. The main method is void. The main method is the entry point of the program.
String[] args is the command line arguments. It is an array of String objects.

Type inference is the automatic deduction of the data type of an expression. In Java, type inference is used for local variable declaration and lambda expressions.
Type inference with var keyword is only available in Java 10 and above.

Final keyword is used to create constants, prevent inheritance, and prevent method overriding.
Final keyword can be used with variables, methods, and classes.
Final variables can be initialized only once. Final variables must be initialized before use.
Final variables when declared outside the method are can be declared as static.
Final methods can also be declared inside the method.

enum are used to define a set of named constants. The enum constants are implicitly final and static.
enum are alternative to static final constants though enum are more powerful.

Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive data types into objects. Wrapper classes are immutable. Wrapper classes are final.

String is immutable. String is a class. String is a reference type.
String is stored in the String pool. String pool is a special memory area in the heap.
String shares the same reference if the value is same.
Creating string using new keyword creates a new object in the heap.

StringBuilder is mutable. It creates object in the heap. It is perfect for string manipulation.
