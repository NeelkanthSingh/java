Java is a compiled/Interpreted language.
Compiled means all the code is converted into machine code before it is executed.
Interpreted means the code is converted into machine code as it is executed.

Java is a statically typed language. This means that the type of variable is known at compile time while in dynamically typed languages, the type of variable is known at run time.

Java code is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
JDK contains JRE which contains JVM. The compiler is part of the JDK.
JRE contains JVM. The interpreter is part of the JRE.
JVM is the same for all platforms. This means that the same Java program can be run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
